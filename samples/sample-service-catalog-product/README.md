## Sample Service Catalog Product

This pipeline is expecting *(in the example case)* a AWS CodeCommit repository on the account `111111111111` in your main deployment region named *sample-service-catalog-product*.

This stack imports values from `sample-vpc` and `sample-iam`.

### Deployment Map example
```yaml
  - name: sample-service-catalog-product
    type: cc-cloudformation
    params:
      - SourceAccountId: 111111111111 # Some Source Account that contains the service-catalog-product content
    targets: # Example Targets OU's
      - /banking/testing
      - path: /banking/production
        regions: eu-west-1
        name: production
```

### Parameters
In the Parameter files for this specific pipeline we are uploading any of the Product templates *(productX/template.yml)* contained within this Repository. We can upload the templates to S3 and reference their S3 Object URL by using the following example:

```json
{
    "Parameters": {
        "ProductXTemplateURL": "upload:eu-central-1:productX/template.yml"
    }
}
```

In this example, ADF will search for a file in `productX/template.yml` within this repository. If found, this will be uploaded to an Amazon S3 Bucket within the region defined within the value *(region is optional)*. Once uploaded, this string will be replaced by the uploaded S3 object URL and passed into the template as required. If the repository contains numerous Service Catalog products they will require their own folder and upload parameter within their associated parameter files *(or global.yml)*.

If the region is omitted from the value when using the **upload** functionality your default deployment region will be used:

```json
{
    "Parameters": {
        "ProductXTemplateURL": "upload:productX/template.yml",
        "ProductYTemplateURL": "upload:productY/another_name.yml"
    }
}
```

In this example, both files within folder `productX` and `productX` will be uploaded to our default deployment region S3 Bucket and have their parameters updated to contain the S3 URL.
