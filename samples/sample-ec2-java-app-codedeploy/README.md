# Sample Spring Boot Java application Running on EC2 deployed via CodePipeline

This example is coupled with the `sample-ec2-with-codedeploy` repository and
is aimed at showcasing how to deploy a basic Java Spring Boot application with
[AWS CodeDeploy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/welcome.html)
via ADF.

## Deployment Map example

```yaml
  - name: sample-ec2-java-app-codedeploy
    # ^ A CodeCommit repo would be created automatically on the source account
    # if it did not exist with this name, granted you are using CodeCommit as
    # a source below.
    default_providers:
      source:
        provider: codecommit
        properties:
          account_id: 111111111111
      build:
        provider: codebuild
        properties:
          image: "STANDARD_5_0"
          # ^ Since we're building a Java application here we want to use
          # STANDARD_5_0 (Ubuntu) as our base CodeBuild Image, that way we can
          # tell it to have Java ready for us so we can build, compile and test
          # our application.
      deploy:
        provider: codedeploy
        # ^ We will deploy out application with AWS CodeDeploy.
    targets:
      - path: 9999999999
        # ^ In this example we only want to deploy to a single AWS Account,
        # so we include its account ID here.
        properties:
          # These are Parameters for this specific stage in the pipeline,
          # CodeDeploy needs to know which application and deployment group
          # it should use to deploy. These resources would typically be deployed
          # in a different stack as they are more part of the infrastructure to
          # support the application as opposed to the application itself.
          application_name: sample
          deployment_group_name: testing-sample
          # ^ See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/deployment-groups.html
