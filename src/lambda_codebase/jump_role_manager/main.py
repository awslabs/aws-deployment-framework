"""
The Jump Role Manager main that is called when ADF is asked to bootstrap an
AWS Account that it has not bootstrapped yet.

This manager is responsible for locking accounts that were bootstrapped before
and granting access to the privileged CrossAccountAccessRole only when we
have not other method to bootstrap/manage the AWS account.

Theory of operation:
    It accesses AWS Organizations and walks through all the accounts that are
    present.

    For each account, it will test if the account is bootstrapped by
    ADF before. It tests this by assuming the Test Bootstrap Role
    (`adf/adf-bootstrap/adf-test-boostrap-role`) in the specific account.
    If that worked, we know that the bootstrap stack is
    present and we should rely on the ADF Bootstrap Update Deployment role
    (`adf/adf-bootstrap/adf-bootstrap-update-deployment-role`).

    If that is not present, we should rely on the CrossAccountAccessRole
    instead.
