Sync files to an S3 Bucket.

This script will only overwrite files when the content changed.
To determine a file changed, it will calculate the SHA-256 hash of the file
and match that against the object SHA256 hash metadata stored along with the
S3 object.

If a file is stored inside the S3 Bucket that is no longer present
locally, it will clean it up too.

Usage:
    sync_to_s3.py [-v... | --verbose...] [-r | --recursive] [-d | --delete]
            [-e <extension> | --extension <extension>]...
            [--metadata <key>=<value>]...
            [--upload-with-metadata <key>=<value>]...
            [-f | --force]
            [--]
            SOURCE_PATH DESTINATION_S3_URL

    sync_to_s3.py -h | --help

    sync_to_s3.py --version

Arguments:
    SOURCE_PATH
                The source path where the original files are stored that should
                by synced to the destination bucket. When you specify a
                directory as the source path it will copy the files inside the
                directory to the S3 bucket if you also specify the recursive
                flag. Otherwise it will treat the source path as a file, when a
                directory is detected instead it will abort with an error.
                If the source path is a directory, the object keys that are
                derived from the files inside the directory will be relative to
                the <source_path>. For example, if the <source_path> equals
                `./adf-accounts`, which contains a file named
                `adf-accounts/adf.yml`, it will copy the file as `adf.yml`.
                If the prefix of the s3 bucket is set to `adf-s3-accounts`, the
                final key of that specific file will be:
                `adf-s3-accounts/adf.yml`.
                If the <source_path> is a file and
                the recursive flag is not specified, it will expect that the
                s3 prefix is the new object name instead. In this case, if
                <source_path> equals `./deployment_map.yml` and the s3 prefix
                is `root_deployment_map.yml`, it will copy the file to the s3
                prefix key.

    DESTINATION_S3_URL
                The destination bucket and its prefix where the files should be
                copied to. The s3 bucket and its optional prefix should be
                specified as: s3://your-bucket-name/your-optional-prefix.
                In this case, `your-bucket-name` is the name of the bucket.
                While `your-optional-prefix` is the name of the prefix used for
                all files that are copied to S3. If a directory is copied, i.e.
                recursive is set, it will prepend the prefix to the object
                keys of the files that are synced. If a file is copied instead,
                i.e. no --recurdive, it will use the s3 prefix as the target
                object key to use for that file.

Options:
    -d, --delete
                Delete stale files that are located in the destination bucket
                with the corresponding S3 prefix. For example, if the
                destination is set to s3://my-bucket/my-prefix, it will sync
                all files inside the prefix location. If a file is located
                there, that is not present in the source path locally, it will
                get deleted. But only if the file extension of that path
                matches (if one is specified).

    -e, --extension <extension>
                File extension filter. Files that match locally are only
                uploaded if their extension matches. If this parameter is not
                specified, it will not apply a filter. Matching all files that
                are found locally. The same filter is also applied on the
                destination. For example, if the destination S3 location
                contains a README.md file, while the extension is configured
                to match '.yml', it will not delete the README.md file as its
                extension is not a match.

    -f, --force
                Force uploading of files that need to be synced. Regardless of
                whether the target metadata matches the local one.
                This also ignores the hash comparison. This is useful if you
                want to force uploading a new copy of all local files to the
                destination S3 bucket.

    -h, --help  Show this help message.

    --metadata <key>=<value>
                The key and value pairs that are passed with this argument
                will be added to the metadata. If the metadata set using this
                argument does not match the metadata on the S3 object, it will
                perform an update too.

    -r, --recursive
                Indicating that the <source_path> is a directory, and it
                should recursively walk through the source directories and sync
                those to the S3 bucket.

    --upload-with-metadata <key>=<value>
                When a file is uploaded, the key and value pairs that are
                passed with this argument will be added. It will only apply
                these metadata properties if the file is missing, or the
                content of the file or any of the `--metadata` properties did
                not match.

    -v, --verbose
                Show verbose logging information.

Examples:

    Copy the deployment_map.yml file to an S3 bucket as
    root_deployment_map.yml, and delete the root_deployment_map.yml if the
    local deployment_map.yml file is missing:

        $ python sync_to_s3.py -d deployment_map.yml \\
            s3://deploy-bucket/root_deployment_map.yml

    Copy all .yml files from the deployment_maps folder to an S3 bucket where
    the objects are prefixed with the `deployment_map/`, deleting the .yml
    objects inside the deployment_map that no longer exist locally.

        $ python sync_to_s3.py -d -e .yml -r deployment_maps \\
            s3://deploy-bucket/deployment_maps
