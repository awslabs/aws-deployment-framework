Description: ADF CloudFormation Template (Global) for IAM in the Deployment Account

# Parameters:
#   OrgStage can be set in the respective adfconfig file using the
#   path config.org.stage
#   OrgStage:
#     Type: "AWS::SSM::Parameter::Value<String>"
#     Description: A stage used to differentiate Multi-Organization ADF environments
#     Default: /adf/org/stage

# Org StageCustom Mappings allows you to dynamically build different IAM
# Conditions / Principals ARN / Resource ARN per Organization applying Least
# Privilege Principals whilst retaining a Single Stack Definition for all
# environments.
# Example usage:
# !FindInMap[OrgStageMap: !Ref OrgStage, ExampleCustomProperty]
# Mappings:
#   OrgStageMap:
#     Dev:
#       ExampleCustomProperty: 1234
#     Int:
#       ExampleCustomProperty: 5678
