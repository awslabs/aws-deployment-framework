# Technical Guide

## Introduction

This document is intended to give insight into how the AWS Deployment Framework
works under the hood.

## High Level Overview - AWS Deployment Framework Bootstrap Repository

The AWS Deployment Framework Bootstrap Repository aka "Bootstrap Repo" is where
the source code used by ADF lives. The bootstrap repo is also where your
accounts, OU layout and base templates are defined.
The flow below is a high level overview of what happens when a change is
committed to this repository.

### Account Management State Machine

The Account Management State Machine is triggered by S3 PUT events to the ADF
Accounts bucket. Below is a diagram detailing the components of the standard
state machine. This state machine is defined in `src/account_processing.yml` and
the lambda functions code is location in
`src/lambda_codebase/account_processing`

## High Level Overview - AWS Deployment Framework Pipeline Repository

The AWS Deployment Framework Pipeline Repository aka "Pipeline Repo" is where
the deployment map definitions live. It typically exists in CodeCommit within
your Deployment Account(s). The diagram below details what happens when a commit
is pushed to this repository.

### Pipeline Management State Machine

The Pipeline Management State machine is triggered by S3 PUT events to the ADF
Pipelines bucket. This state machine is responsible for expanding the deployment
map, resolving the targets, creating pipeline definitions (JSON objects that
detail the source(s) and stages involved and the targets) and then generating
CDK stacks off of the definitions.

It additionally covers the deletion of stale pipelines. A Stale pipeline is any
pipeline that was created by ADF initially, but is no longer defined in a
deployment map.
