# AWS Deployment Framework

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/awslabs/aws-deployment-framework.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/awslabs/aws-deployment-framework)

The AWS Deployment Framework *(ADF)* is an extensive and flexible framework to manage and deploy resources across multiple AWS accounts and regions within an AWS Organization.

ADF allows for staged, parallel, multi-account, cross-region deployments of applications or resources via the structure defined in [AWS Organizations](https://aws.amazon.com/organizations/) while taking advantage of services such as [AWS CodePipeline](https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/), [AWS CodeBuild](https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/) and [AWS CodeCommit](https://aws.amazon.com/codecommit/) to alleviate the heavy lifting and management compared to a traditional CI/CD setup.

ADF allows for clearly defined deployment and approval stages which are stored in a centralized configuration file. It also allows for account based bootstrapping, by which you define an [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) template and assign it to a specific Organization Unit (OU) within AWS Organizations. From there, any account you move into this OU will automatically apply this template as its baseline.

## Quick Start

Launch ADF via the [Serverless Application Repository](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home?region=us-east-1#/create/app?applicationId=arn:aws:serverlessrepo:us-east-1:112893979820:applications/aws-deployment-framework) within the AWS Console.

- Refer to the [Installation Guide](/docs/installation-guide.md) for Installation steps.
- Refer to the [User Guide](/docs/user-guide.md) for using ADF once it is setup.
- Refer to the [Samples Guide](/docs/samples-guide.md) for a detailed walk through of the provided samples.
